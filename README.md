# DA_PUF_Library
Defense/Attack PUF Library (DA PUF Library)

Authors: Durga Prasad Sahoo, Phuong Ha Nguyen, Chenglu Jin and Kaleel Mahmood

DA PUF Library contains the following source codes:

1. MATLAB codes for simulating and attacking Arbiter PUFs, XOR Arbiter PUFs and Interpose PUFs. The availabe attacking methods include Logistic Regression, reliability based CMA-ES attack and CMA-ES attack based on challenge response pairs. Also, k junta tests on Arbiter PUF, XOR Arbiter PUF, and Interpose PUF are available.
2. C# codes for simulating and attacking Arbiter PUFs and XOR Arbiter PUFs. Notice that, this C# code supports parallel computing. 
3. Python codes for running deep neural network attack on XOR Arbiter PUFs. 
3. FPGA implmenetation of Arbiter PUFs, XOR Arbiter PUFs and Interpose PUFs.

If you need to reference to this library, please cite paper "The Interpose PUF: Secure PUF Design against State-of-the-art Machine Learning Attacks", published at CHES 2019, authored by Phuong Ha Nguyen, Durga Prasad Sahoo, Chenglu Jin, Kaleel Mahmood, Ulrich Ruhrmair, and Marten van Dijk.
